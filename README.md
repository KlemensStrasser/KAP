# KAP - Accessibility plugin for Unity

## Why?

Accessibility tools in modern operating systems help users modify the system to their personal needs. Those tools range from simple settings like increasing the font size system wide, to software that helps people with motor disabilities navigate their phones using a single switch. Developers can leverage those tools  to make their own software accessible to every user. But a big area where this kind of leverage is often not possible are video games, because of the usage of game engines like Unity. These engines make it easy to bring the game to a wide range of platforms, but also make the game miss out on platform specific accessibility features. Since the Unity engine doesn’t provide any accessibility tools, game studios have to create their own. Many game studios simply cannot afford to go this extra mile or simply do might not even know how big of a difference having accessibility tools can make to many users. Thats the reason why the KAP project came to live. 

The KAP Unity package provides some simple tools that will help you make your game more accessible.  The package leverages system specific features, provides access to system settings and also includes tools that will work on every platform. 

KAP is an open source project and can be used without any fees. If any feature is not supported on the platform you’re working on, please contribute to the project!
